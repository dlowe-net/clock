Clock - A Common Lisp date/time library
=======================================

Clock is an attempt to make a useful, mature date/time library.  It is
heavily based on the work done on the LOCAL-TIME library, with
abstractions for different calendaring, time systems, and timezone
handling.  Emphasis has also been placed on commonly used operations,
such as getting the next date in a repeated series.  It attempts to
provide useful selections when the results are ambiguous, and to
generate errors for invalid operations.
